# ✨ ***ical-mutex*** ✨


iCal-mutex is just an app to proxy ADE's ics calendar to do some tweaking, making it more readable

Will only work with `ade-outils.insa-lyon.fr`.

I wrote it as a first year student so the course indicator directory is incomplete, report any new entries to the dictionnary in the Github's issues or to `aarys.sahler@insa-lyon.fr`.

To use it, simply put `https://ical-mutex.vsahler.fr/?` in front of your ade url, for example: `https://ical-mutex.vsahler.fr/?https://ade-outils.insa-lyon.fr/ADE-Cal:~asahler!2022...`
